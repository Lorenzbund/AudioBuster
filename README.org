* AudioBuster
** Compiling
Your audio server must be configurable through =pactl=
run =ghc AudioBuster.hs=
You might want to rename =./AudioBuster= to simply =./ab=

** Usage
--help should be available on every command
+ =./AudioBuster init=
  for creating a new null-sink
+ =./AudioBuster list=
  list current Sinks, Sources, SinkInputs and SourceOutputs (+could+ vill be prettier)
+ =./AudioBuster configure=
+ =./AudioBuster hclean=
  cleans all null-sinks. This currently leaks the file created with =./AudioBuster init=, just delete it.
